\begin{abstract}
The Internet is an incredible resource, enabling the storage and sharing
of data amongst 40\% of the world\textquoteright s population. However,
these storage locations are inherently insecure and enable mass surveillance
and data theft by companies and world Governments. This paper proposes
a solution by redesigning and reimplementing the Internet\textquoteright s
underlying infrastructure to require no central control and by implication,
no servers as we currently know them. The ideas presented here allow
the creation of a network, which provides average users the opportunity
to retain complete control of their own security and personal information.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction [UPDATE arguments and sources]}

Computing capability has increased dramatically in recent years, enabling
the creation of some incredible advancements. % As Moore\textquoteright s law successfully predicted for a number of years, the processing power of computers has doubled every 2 years while the increase in the connectivity of devices is growing exponentially. The so called Internet of Things (IOT - interconnection of identifiable devices), was predicted to rise from an estimated 1.3 billion devices at the end of 2010 to 1.6 billion units worldwide by the end of 2015\footnote{http://www.idate.org/en/News/Digital-Home-Connectable-devices\_693.html}.
Furthermore, the distribution of faster Internet has also played its part with an estimated rise in average worldwide connection (download)
speed of 2.1Mbps in Q1 2011 to 3.9 Mbps in Q1 2014\cite{statisticaInternet14}.
These technological advancements, faster infrastructure and greater
availability have led to products and services that were previously
not possible. For example, the delivery of voice and multimedia communications
(VOIP) between mobile devices are now common place.
These advancements have not only provided the human race with a greater
suite of tools than ever before, they have also led to fundamental
changes in how we communicate with each other. The rise of social
networking websites, mobile devices and mobile applications has led
to an explosion in what and how much data we share with each other.
%Zuckerberg\textquoteright s Law, as it has become known, takes inspiration from Moore\textquoteright s Law and states that the amount of data Facebook users share doubles every year \footnote{http://www.technologyreview.com/review/426438/the-law-of-online-sharing/}. While the maths of Zuckerberg\textquoteright s Law has been called into question by some commentators, who helpfully point out that by 2031 we will be sharing 1,048,576 times more data per day than we do at present, the sentiment that we share increasing amounts of data is clear.

This technological evolution is not only affecting how much data we
share, it is also heavily impacting upon where consumers store data.
Market research agency Gartner predict that users will store 36\%
of their content online by 2016, a sharp increase from an estimated
7\% in 2011%
\footnote{http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/07/02/gartner-consumers-will-store-more-in-the-cloud/}. Gartner goes on to suggest that the average household stored 464
GB online in 2011 and is forecast to rise to 3.3 TB by 2016, driven
by an increased desire to share and by consumers' use of multiple devices
(as storing online enables them to access all their data across all
their devices).

While these enhancements take technological ease of use to the next
level, these convenient and often free services come at a price. The
price is freedom. Today\textquoteright s centralised Internet architecture,
where centralised and managed intermediaries (servers) store and provide
access to information, do so in an inherently insecure way. We also
experience an ever increasing number of concerns over the privacy
of our data and this paper argues that it is in fact human involvement,
and the existing client server architecture\textquoteright s requirement
for human organisation, that leads to these security and privacy issues.

MaidSafe proposes and implements a new, decentralised architecture that eliminates human involvement in private data.  Hence we enable users to enjoy the significant resources of the Internet, without selling out on their privacy to do so.


\section{The Internet is broken}

The fact that the Internet has grown beyond the expected use cases of the original design is, at the very least, a strong motivation to consider a renewed architecture. It is evident looking back, that the current volume of
2.8 billion regular users\footnote{http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm} was not anticipated, nor was the original design of ARPANET centralising. In fact, one of Bob Kahn\textquoteright s fundamental rules, when designing the transmission control protocol (TCP), was that there would be no global control at the operations level\footnote{http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet}. However, some of these principles took a back seat as other considerations took priority.

It was originally envisioned, back in the late 1960\textquoteright s,
that there would be multiple independent networks and as Leiner et
al suggested \textquotedblleft 256 networks would be sufficient
for the foreseeable future'', was clearly in need of consideration
when Local Area Networks (LANS) began to appear in the late 1970\textquoteright s%
\footnote{http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet\#f2%
}. The addition of workstations, PC\textquoteright s and Ethernet technology,
in addition to LANs, also led to changes in the original architecture
concepts. The rapid and unforeseen rise in the Internet\textquoteright s
growth introduced scaling issues (the single algorithm employed with
all routers could not cope with demand) that were dealt with by the
implementation of a hierarchal routing model. This approach led to
a centralising of it\textquoteright s architecture, with the introduction
of \textquotedblleft managed interconnection points\textquotedblright{}
by US Federal agencies. 

This enabled more \textquotedblleft rapid configuration robustness
and better scaling to be accommodated\textquotedblright \footnote{http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet}. As the National Science Foundation (NSF) started to privatise and
commercialise the program in 1995, the use of regional networks via
private long haul carriers led to the information superhighway, envisioned
by Tim Berners-Lee, that we are familiar with today. However, as the
Internet has continued to grow, it is suggested that this change in
direction has led to some significant problems that not only impact
upon the way the world\textquoteright s citizens manage data, it is
having a much more profound impact on society as a whole. 


\subsection{Government Control}

Governments spying and eavesdropping is nothing new\footnote{http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24749166}. Letters have been intercepted for centuries and spy networks have existed for millennia. In recent times, attention has shifted from
telegrams to email. Within the US, Project Shamrock, established after
the Second World War, legally accessed all the cables of RCA Global,
ITT, and Western Union. Minaret was another project, established in
the 1960s to focus on intelligence gathering amongst domestic targets%
\footnote{http://www.vice.com/read/a-brief-history-of-the-united-states-governments-warrentless-spying%
}. Despite both programs being exposed and subsequently shelved, they
were the pre-cursor to ECHELON, that utilises automatic
keyword searching of faxes, telex and emails.  Back in 2001 the European Parliament saw the reach of the ECHELON program limited: 
\begin{quote}
[\dots] however extensive the resources and capabilities for the interception of communications may be, the extremely high volume of traffic makes exhaustive, detailed monitoring of all communications impossible in practice.
\end{quote}
 
Technological advance over the past decade has refuted the assumption of this report.  Centralisation driven by cloud services has facilitated the impact of surveillance programs. The Snowden revelations demonstrated that
intelligence agencies are able to access data at will from some of
the world\textquoteright s largest technology companies (PRISM) and
by tapping data direct from fibre optic cables (TEMPORA, FAIRVIEW,
STORMBREW, OAKSTAR and BLARNEY)\cite{guardianNSA}. Although denied by almost all technology companies, NSA slides suggest
they were complicit, willing or otherwise, in helping to collect this
data\cite{guardian13}.

This paper proposes that the existing centralised architecture (in
the case of PRISM) and the involvement of humans make these privacy
intrusions possible. All existing services require that users are
authenticate onto them.  While this process is automated, the credentials
of the users are stored in centralised locations. Furthermore, the
encryption keys are held by the service provider, enabling them to
access to their users data\cite{lambert12}. While client side encryption technology is available, it is not standard practice to implement it in end-user products. Additionally most cloud service companies are based within the US and as such are legally obliged to comply with Government agency
requests for user data.

Interestingly, much of this monitoring conflicts with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights that the US and UK Government and their
allies have signed up to in 1948. Article 12 states\cite{unhrd12}
\begin{quote}
\textquotedblleft No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference
with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon
his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection
of the law against such interference or attacks.\textquotedblright
\end{quote}
The evidence suggests that, over a lengthy period, these Governments
have chosen to ignore a fundamental human right, the individuals right
to privacy. However, it is not just nations that choose to invade
our privacy.  As the internet was designed without inherent privacy protections at protocol level, technology companies also take advantage of the centralised Internet architecture to profit from private data.

\subsection{Surveillance as a business model }

Security expert Bruce Schneier notably stated at SOURCE conference in Boston:\cite{boston14}
\begin{quote}
\textquotedblleft Surveillance is the business model of the Internet. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. Corporations call it marketing.\textquotedblright
\end{quote}
This suggestion is based on the fact that many large technology
companies generate the overwhelming majority of their revenue by
mining their users data. The revenue model of companies like Google
and Facebook is to provide their core services free from monetary
charge and then sell access to their users to companies who pay to
advertise on their platform. Google generated \$50.5~billion in advertising
revenue during 2013 which equated to 91\% of their yearly sales\cite{google13}. Similarly, Facebook delivered advertising revenue of over \$6.9
billion to their investors over the same period, equivalent to 89\%
of their income\cite{facebook13}. 

Ethan Zuckerman (Director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and
principal research scientist at MIT\textquoteright s Media Lab) has
suggested that:\cite{zuckerman14}
\begin{quote}
\textquotedblleft The fallen state of our Internet is a direct, if
unintentional, consequence of choosing advertising as the default
model to support online content and services.\textquotedblright 
\end{quote}
Zuckerman goes onto argue that Facebook, Google and others, are under
more and more pressure from shareholders to sell more and more adverts.
They will only sell more if they can offer their customers more and
more insights into their users backgrounds, and they can only do this
if they continue to mine more and more data. The ad supported web
has driven Internet adoption and has enabled many of today\textquoteright s
\textquoteleft free\textquoteright{} services to become available.

This paper suggests that the ad supported web, while not being directly
responsible for the move toward a more centralised architecture, has
none the less had a part to play. It is much easier to mine our data
when it is held in unencrypted and centralised locations under direct control of the service provider.

 

\subsection{Security}

Security of data is an issue that goes hand in hand with privacy,
as without security data cannot remain private. A European Commission
project, the ABC4Trust, suggests that users want privacy and organisations
want security, however, it could be argued that information stolen
from business typically also affects individuals and therefore both
groups desire security, albeit of differing importance\cite{euABC4Trust}.

Whilst opinion on this point may vary from reader to reader, evidence
suggests that security is about as scarce as privacy within today\textquoteright s
centralised Internet. At a time when the revenue generated by the
Internet as a whole is estimated to exceed \$4.2 trillion in G20 countries
alone, and with companies storing and sharing highly valued and sensitive
information, demand for Internet data security has never been greater\cite{bcg12}. %Previously ignored by the security community, it is now widely recognised that the weakest link in the security chain are people \footnote{http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/144215/1/BTTJSECv5.pdf}.

In a UK Government survey on security breaches, 93\% of large organisations
and 87\% of SME\textquoteright s experienced a security breach in
2013. The survey reported that major breaches were typically caused
by a combination of failures in not only people, but also process
and the technology itself\cite{ukgov13}: 
\begin{quotation}
\textquotedblleft 36\% of the worst security breaches in the year
were caused by inadvertent human error (and a further 10\% by deliberate
misuse of systems by staff)\textquotedblright{} 
\end{quotation}
What is also evident is that these problems are not sector specific
and are taking place across all industries including healthcare, finance
and education%
\footnote{http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/data-breach-trends%
}.

In some cases the human element of these breaches is quite simple.
Users typically gain access to a system by entering a user identification
(ID) and password, with the userid providing the identification and
the password providing the authentication. This method is preferred
as it is seen to be a low cost option in comparison with other technologies,
such as biometrics. However, passwords come with an overhead, users
need to login to each system individually and subsequently reuse the
same password across multiple systems. A US consumer study found that
61\% of people use an identical password across many websites, with
54\% of the study\textquoteright s respondents having 5 passwords
or less%
\footnote{http://www.csid.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CS\_PasswordSurvey\_FullReport\_FINAL.pdf%
}. It is also clear that because users are not able to cope with the
demands made on their memory they do not follow recommended etiquette
and reset them regularly or use strong (combining letters and numbers)
passwords.

With global cyber crime costing an estimated 400 billion per year,
it has a huge impact on society, companies and consumers%
\footnote{http://www.mcafee.com/uk/about/news/2014/q2/20140609-01.aspx%
}. In December 2013, 40 million credit card details were stolen from
a prominent US retailer with the haul also including 70 million addresses
and other personal information. Similarly, in what appears to be a
series of attacks, a Russian group has amassed an estimated 1.2 billion
user names and passwords%
\footnote{http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/technology/russian-gang-said-to-amass-more-than-a-billion-stolen-internet-credentials.html?\_r=0%
}. 

With businesses continuing to store valuable information in what are
insecure centralised points, managed by people that empirical evidence
suggests are prone to mistakes, a change is clearly required. Failure
to adapt to these issues will only ensure that they continue. It would
seem that what is required is a change to the fundamental architecture
of the Internet, one that removes central points of weakness and humans
from the process of data management. This fresh approach should clearly
have security and privacy inherent within the design. 


\section{Nature may have the answer}

Complex systems have existed in nature for hundreds of millions of
years. As the name suggests, they typically exhibit complex and often
dynamic behaviours, that occur throughout an organisation between
multiple component systems. These organisations are inseparable from
their environment and continually adapt to their surroundings, examples
include; the human brain, ant colonies, societies and the human immune
system, to name just a few%
\footnote{https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/34898763/Paul\_etal\_wwrf32\_vault\_network.pdf%
}. 

There are several attributes that have been identified that appear
consistently within each Complex Adaptive System (CAS), and while
all are important, four in particular are particularly relevant to
the topic of this paper, these are%
\footnote{http://www.health.org.uk/public/cms/75/76/313/2590/Complex\%20adaptive\%20systems\%20research\%20scan.pdf?realName=zv8j6f.pdf%
}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed Control 
\item Connectivity 
\item Emergent Order 
\item State of Paradox
\end{itemize}
It is interesting that highly evolved natural systems, such as ant
colonies, thought to have evolved over a period of 130 million years,
do so with distributed control, or put another way, without centralised
control. It is also intriguing that humans have chosen to ignore the
lessons that nature has learned over many millennia of forming natural
systems when it came to designing the architecture of the Internet. 

Another important aspect of natural systems is that they remain connected,
not only to themselves, but also to their environment. Activity within
one part of the system ripples through and impacts upon another. Furthermore,
an emergent order, defined by Chan (2001) as \textquoteleft \dots several
agents working in parallel\textquotedblright , similar to nerve cells
in the brain, can be seen to be random behaviour, and that nothing
within this environment is fixed. It is highly adaptable, thriving
on the \textquotedblleft competition and co-operation among the agents
themselves.\textquotedblright{} This ties in with the final point,
that complex systems are typically in a state of paradox and flux,
as those which are unable to adapt to their environment will no longer
exist. As suggested by complex system theorists, such systems are
at their most effective and productive when they are \textquotedblleft on
the edge of chaos\textquotedblright %
\footnote{http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/ComplexityKD.PDF%
}. As we will see, these are attributes that are inherent within the
proposed solution.


\section{The SAFE network - a new network design}

Taking inspiration from complex natural systems, and specifically
ant colonies, Scottish engineer David Irvine set about the problem
of providing a secure data and communications platform and formed
a company, MaidSafe, to implement his design. The values of the company
are to provide privacy, security and freedom for all and one of most
pertinent aspects of the system design has been to remove central
points of weakness (servers) while removing the need to rely on human
intervention. 

The system is a fully decentralised, server less, P2P design with
the objective of providing a self managing global network. The network
is comprised by the users, who each donate their spare computing resources
to it and are incentivised via a network token for doing so. Each
user establishes a node, or vault to which the network assigns its
own unique address (derived from a cryptographic hash). This address
is known only by the network%
\footnote{https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/34898763/Paul\_etal\_wwrf32\_vault\_network.pdf%
}.

It is possible to store any type of data (structured and unstructured)
on each vault, with typically each user running a client which enables
network requests to be made. Vaults on the network don\textquoteright t
only serve to store data, they perform multiple functions (persona\textquoteright s)
including managing not only the integrity of the nodes themselves,
but also the data chunks contained within the closest 4 nodes. In
this sense, closest refers to the distance in the networks address
space as opposed to the geographical distance. The closest nodes will
continually change as nodes go on and offline. This consensus based
system (3 out of 4 can make a decision) ensures that each node follows
the rules of the network and minimises undesirable or malicious behaviour. 

Data is stored on the network in encrypted chunks, so as files are
saved to the network, they go through a process that MaidSafe term
Self Encryption. During this process files are separated into chunks
before being assigned a unique identifier (hash). The chunks are then
encrypted and stored on vaults at different locations throughout the
network%
\footnote{http://maidsafe.net/libraries-encrypt%
}.

In the interests of data availability, the network retains 4 live
copies of each data chunk at any time. So as vaults go on and offline,
these data chunks are dynamically moved around the network. The network
uses a process of deduplication (each data chunk is assigned it\textquoteright s
own unique hash) to mitigate storing these replicant copies. Deduplication
can reduce the amount of data stored by up to 95\%, as a large proportion
of data is believed to be non-unique%
\footnote{http://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetPDF.aspx\%2F4AA3-8728ENW.pdf%
}.

INSERT VAULT DIAGRAM HERE

To compel each node to adhere to the rules of the network a ranking
scheme has been employed. The ranking score is based on the networks
ability to successfully retrieve an uncorrupted data chunk from a
node. This reputation scheme is scored by the 4 nodes closest to the
data chunk. It is envisioned that ranking vaults in this way will
promote desirable behaviour and mitigate the potential for gaming
the network and attacks.


\subsection{Data in a hostile environment}

The problems of data surveillance, security and privacy and multi
faceted and the SAFE network employs a number of features to provide
a potential solution. By decentralising the storage of data, the SAFE
network makes it more challenging for Governments to retrieve information.
The network stores data at random over a huge and constantly changing
(network churn as users turn their devices off and on) address space
(2 \ensuremath{\bigwedge}512) and therefore predicting the storage
location of the data is computationally infeasible. As the data is
automatically stored as encrypted fragments with each chunk of data
unlinked to the next, even if an adversary were to locate a piece
of data it would be very challenging to reconstitute the file, as
this would require the Xor, obfuscation and hashing process to be
reversed and even then, only a fraction of the file would have been
obtained.

Anonymity is also a crucial element of the network. One of the requirements
full decentralisation creates is that users self authenticate themselves
onto the network by enabling them to create their own unique key,
facilitating the SAFE network user to store a value on the network.
This value contains a passport, which is essentially a variety of
cryptographic keys for performing different network tasks%
\footnote{http://maidsafe.net/Whitepapers/pdf/SelfAuthentication.pdf%
}. In turn, this provides users with the ability to manage their own
identity for the first time. Authentication is a service provided
by third parties on the existing Internet. The authentication information,
which includes details about the user, is typically held in a centralised
location. Self authentication within the SAFE network provides users
with anonymity as no entity, MaidSafe included, is aware of any information
about any of it\textquoteright s users. This feature also ensures
that access to the network can never be restricted to any individual. 

The (self) encryption process ensures that data on the network is
always encrypted, whether at rest or in transit and as data is only
ever decrypted by the client (on the users machine) the encryption
password cannot be stolen from the network. Combined with decentralised
data storage, this feature is likely to reduce the high instance of
data breaches that both companies and individuals currently experience.
However, it does not mitigate them entirely as reconstituted network
data can be moved onto an unencrypted memory stick (data is only automatically
encrypted on the network) and left in a public place or lost. 

Holding data in encrypted form would not only present issues to adversaries,
companies would also have to adapt. As has been discussed, large Internet
companies make much of their revenue by mining user data, but what
if that data was always encrypted when in the network? It is still
possible to run computations and analyse such data, know as Homomorphic
Encryption, although it is still to slow and inefficient for practical
use%
\footnote{http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2012/5/alice-and-bob-in-cipherspace%
}. Until technology is this space develops, companies that currently
make their revenue via advertising would need to consider alternate
revenue streams, such as charging a subscription for their service. 

It is also worth considering the robustness that the SAFE network
provides. As the network is comprised of the resources of its users,
as opposed to a central location, it cannot be turned off and no kill
switch exists. Furthermore, the network does not use the Domain Name
System (DNS) making it impossible to distinguish SAFE network traffic
from other types, making it impervious to web censoring. Governments
looking to stop access to the network would need to shut off the entire
Internet to do so. However, despite many of these advantages, there
are many challenges that the network needs to overcome to achieve
wide scale adoption.


\subsection{Adoption challenges}

It is proposed that the SAFE network offers a solution to many of
the security and privacy challenges experienced with the Internet
today. However, even if the implementation and wide scale adoption
of the network is assumed, it still leaves many considerations for
which answers are not yet known. Governments will still want to surveil
both their citizens and others who they deem to be a potential threat.
The lack of central vulnerabilities or attack points makes eaves dropping
more difficult, however, world Governments are well resourced with
skilled people and with funding. Due to the consensus model in place
within the vault network (3 out of 4 make a decision), it is thought
that if an adversary controlled 75\% of the network (by providing
lots of resource), there is a potential for individual chunks of data
to be corrupted or deleted. Attacks can also take a non technical
form. For example, public relations efforts to discredit the network
to the public, slowing and even halting adoption are also possible.

Removing advertising as a form of payment for online services will
also require significant adjustment and many companies who experience
significant success with the status quo will be highly resistant to
change. Many of these companies are, like world Governments, well
resourced and highly motivated. If these issues can be overcome, a
new way of financing the decentralised Internet will need to be established.
Users will need to start paying for many of the services they currently
use free from monetary charge. 

Users will still pay for services that they derive value from, maybe
Google and Facebook would receive revenue from subscription fees?
However, a fee model would also have potentially negative consequences,
as many users may stop using services that they refuse to pay for,
removing many companies and jobs from the sector. Maybe this gap could
be bridged by introducing more accessible and inclusive payment mechanisms
that enable a larger percentage of the world population to take part.
Currencies such as M-Pesa (mobile money) are more popular and within
reach of much of the population of Africa, as opposed to the traditional
payment mechanisms of the Internet (Visa, MasterCard and Paypal)%
\footnote{http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single\_page=true%
}. 

Crypto currencies could also offer part of the solution. Currencies
such as Bitcoin provide extremely low transaction fees opening up
the potential for micro payments for all types of content. Content
owners could be paid a fraction of a bitcoin (the smallest denomination
is a Satoshi representing 0.00000001 bitcoin) for part of an article
or for 10 frames of a movie, for example. The charges are so small
the content consumers may not give this spend much thought, while
the provider realises income and is motivated to create great content.
At present bitcoin has some technical challenges around transaction
speed (it takes 60 minutes to confirm a transaction) that would limit
it's usefulness. However, other currencies, such as NXT, Stellar,
Ripple, exist on alternative platforms that do offer the required
transaction speed, if not the liquidity of bitcoin. In addition to
integrating alternate currencies onto the SAFE network, it should
also be noted that the SAFE network also retains its own currency,
safecoin, which will have sufficient transaction speed and divisibility
to be a viable solution. 

Clearly there is no obvious answer to the question of how to fund
a new decentralised Internet, and it is out with the scope of this
paper to attempt to find one. There are many alternatives and the
question for users to answer is, would they rather pay for services
with their freedom or with money?


\section*{Conclusion}

The SAFE network potentially provides a solution to those looking
to enjoy the vast resources of the Internet without many of the downsides,
which include surveillance from governments and companies. The SAFE
network also aims to minimise many of the security risks that currently
exist with the existing Internet. The SAFE network has been implemented
in a decentralised architecture and has been designed in this way
to remove the requirement for human intervention from our data, while
also removing servers, which act as a central point of weakness.
